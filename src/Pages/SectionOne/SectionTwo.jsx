          Chefs are responsible for handling all food-related concerns and
          taking care of all food preparation needs at restaurants or any other
          places where food is regularly served. They may be required to cook,
          bake and prepare predetermined menu items on a daily basis, or they
          may be asked to come up with new menu ideas and develop delicious
          dishes. It is important to highlight the ideal qualifications you want
          from a chef in the skills and qualifications section of your chef job
          description. For example, if you want your chef to have specific
          training from a culinary arts school or four-year college, be sure to
          specify this in your job description. Chefs should be able to work
          well and keep their cool in a fast-paced work environment. For more
          details about what goes into a great chef job description, consult the
          example below.
